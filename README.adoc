== Two-minutes tutorial

An example is worth a thousand words:

[source,kotlin]
----
include::{sourceDir}/doc/FirstStepUI.kt[tags=simpleusageui]
----

<1> Import the namespace `ch.frankel.kaadin.*`
1. There's one Kaadin function for each Vaadin component _e.g._ `button()` maps `Button()`
<2> The topmost component will automatically be added as the `UI` content. There's one such function per link:Components.adoc[common Vaadin component].
<3> Nested blocks allow to add children components and configure them

== User manual

The best user manual is a link:{sourceDir}/sammpler/KaadinSampler.kt[sampler] demoing usage of each function.

It's a full-fledged Vaadin application so it can be run either inside your own servlet-container (3.0+) or directly from the command-line:

[source,bash]
----
mvn install
cd kaadin-sampler
mvn package org.apache.tomcat.maven:tomcat7-maven-plugin:run
----

== Features

=== Set the theme

Theme setting is common to all Vaadin applications.

Beside the `@Theme` annotation, Kotlin's syntax allows for a straightforward code:

[source,kotlin]
----
class SetThemeUI() : UI() {
    override fun init(request: VaadinRequest) {
        theme = "valo" <1>
    }
}
----
<1> Use Kotlin's properties syntactic sugar, equivalent of `setTheme("valo")`

In addition, Kaadin provides a `theme(theme: String)` function to set the theme. This allows for dynamic behavior:

[source,kotlin]
----
include::{sourceDir}/doc/SetThemeUI.kt[tags=setthemeui]
----

<1> Define the listener function as a lambda function
<2> Set the theme, taken from the radio button value
<3> Create the option group, passing along the lambda

=== Use the Navigator API

Vaadin Navigator's API requires components added as views to implement the `View` interface. Most of the time, this is only boilerplate since the `enter()` method is empty.

Kaadin allows to use any of the existing layout as views - provided one of Kaadin's method to create them is used.

[source,kotlin]
----
include::{sourceDir}/doc/NavigatorUI.kt[tags=navigatorui]
----

<1> Configure the navigator with a placeholder layout. This also sets the layout as the content of the UI
<2> Configure the default view in the navigator
<3> Configure an additional view in the navigator
<4> Navigate to the second view using the navigator's API on the click of the button
<5> Navigate to the default view
